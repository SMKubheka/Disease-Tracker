# Disease-Tracker

This app is meant to help with contact tracing in the Covid-19 pandemic. The idea is that users will
voluntarily ”check in” at locations to indicate that they are currently at a particular location. The
system will record all of these check ins. Users can then report if they are diagnosed with Covid-19,
and if they are, any other user who is at risk can check this when they log in.

1. The system must have a predefined list of locations. (GPS support is not required but it will be
very impressive if a group does include this)

2. Users must be able to indicate that they have been to a particular place on a particular day.

3. Users must be able to indicate that they have been diagnosed with Covid-19

4. Users must be able to query whether they are at risk for Covid-19 because they were at a
particular location on the same day as someone with Covid-19.

5. Users must be able to see a list of locations along with number of infected people who have
been to that location
